Menu:

    - has launch game trigger
    - can launch a Game(ui, options),
    which gives control back to menu only when it exits
    - has history that shows what previous Game-launches have done

Game:
    - sets up a new Match(ui, rules, team1, team2) with the given options
    - runs the Match
    - stores the result of the match in a file
Match:
    - iterates Periods which iterate Turns which iterate Batters which iterates Battings
    - the rules dictate how many periods, turns per period, fouls per turn, etc.
    - creates and passes on a MatchStatus(rules), which is regularly checked for the need to e.g. stop the turn
